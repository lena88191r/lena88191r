- 👋 Hi, I’m Lena
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating with any project at all.

- 📫 Reach me on twitter/X and Instagram, I'm @lena88191r there.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm actually mostly self taught, I've done some courses but I began reading books about coding with python and ruby, how to design a website and software engineering. Also, I love fantasy books.
